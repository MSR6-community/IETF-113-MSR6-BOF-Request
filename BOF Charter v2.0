The MSR6 WG focuses on source routing multicast based on native IPv6 (IPv6 and IPv6 extension headers), including Best Effort and Traffic Engineering solutions, which is able to decouple multicast forwarding with per flow status in intermediate nodes, similar as SRv6 for unicast.
 
MSR6 WG will manage its specific work items by milestones agreed with the responsible Area Director.
A proposed milestone:

o  Jun 2022   Initial Standards Track document for MSR6 best effort
o  Jul 2022   Initial Standards Track document for MSR6 TE 
o  Nov 2022   Initial Standards Track document for MSR6 TE Policy
o  Dec 2022   Initial Standards Track document for MSR6 MVPN       
o  Jun 2023   Adopt Standards Track document for MSR6 best effort
o  Jul 2023   Adopt Standards Track document for MSR6 Traffic Engineering

The work-items of the MSR6 WG include functional specifications for:
 
o  New types of MSR6 segments mapping to forwarding behavior and IPv6 Encapsulation for MSR6 Best Effort. 
o  New types of MSR6 segments mapping to forwarding behavior and IPv6 Encapsulation for MSR6 Traffic Engineering.
o  MSR6 associated steering and signaling mechanisms.
o  MSR6 YANG Model.
o  MSR6 OAM.
o  MSR6 Security.

Use cases and requirements are not included in the charter but WG will have documents to give guidance about the target scenarios.
Any modification of or extension to existing architectures, data planes, or control or management plane protocols must be carried out in the working groups responsible for the architecture, data plane, or control or management plane protocol being modified and in co-ordination with this working group, but may be done in this working group after agreement with all the relevant WG chairs and responsible Area Directors. 
Here are potential interactions with other WG:

o  6MAN: IPv6 Extension Header
o  LSR:  IGP Extensions 
o  BESS:  MVPN
